## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Environment

## Idea
Gamified E-Waste Management Platform


## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
The platform will consist of two main parts:

1.Web App: User-facing interface for locating facilities, earning points, and accessing educational content.
2.Backend System: Manages data on e-waste facilities, user accounts, points, and educational content.

## Use Cases
1.Locate E-Waste Facility: User enters their location or allows the app to access geolocation data. The app displays the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facilities.
2.View Educational Content: User accesses pop-up information or dedicated sections explaining the harmful components of e-waste and their environmental and health impacts if not disposed of properly.
3.Input Device Model (Optional): User enters the model of their old device. The system estimates the amount of recoverable precious metals and awards points based on this estimation. (Points system can be further developed with rewards or recognition)

## Technology Stack
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript framework (e.g., ReactJS, AngularJS)
Backend: Python (with Django or Flask framework) or Node.js (with Express framework)
Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB
Mapping Service: Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap integration
## Dependencies
1.Geolocation API (for user location)
2.E-waste Facility Database (requires collaboration with relevant authorities to obtain and update data)
3.(Optional) Precious Metal Content Database (for estimating points based on device model)
