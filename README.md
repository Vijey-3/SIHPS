## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.
## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Environment

## Idea
Gamified E-Waste Management Platform


## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
The platform will consist of two main parts:

1.Web App: User-facing interface for locating facilities, earning points, and accessing educational content.
2.Backend System: Manages data on e-waste facilities, user accounts, points, and educational content.
